# Naming Convensions

### Package Names
##### Package names are all lowercase, with consecutive words simply concatenated together.
```
com.risk.model , com.risk.controller
```
### Class File Names
##### The source file name consists of the case-sensitive name of the top-level class it contains, plus the .java extension. Class names are written in UpperCamelCase.
```
MapController.java, GameWindow.java
```
### Test Class Names
Test classes are named starting with the name of the class they are testing, and ending with Tests.
```
MapControllerTests.java
```
### Method Names
##### Method names are written in lower camel case. Method names are typically verbs or verb phrases. 
```
validateMap, checkCountriesConnected
```

```
COMMA_JOINER
```
### Non-constant filed Names, Parameter Names and Local Variable Names
##### These names use lowerCamelCase.
```
index, fileContent
```

# Layout

##### A source file consists of, in order:

* ##### Package statement: which is not line-wrapped
* ##### Import statement: No wildcard imports and No line wrapping.
* ##### Class Declaration: Exactly one top level class declaration.

```
/**

 *  
 * {Purpose of this Class}
 *  
 * {Other notes relating to the class}
 *  
 * @author
 * @version 
 */
```

*/
```
